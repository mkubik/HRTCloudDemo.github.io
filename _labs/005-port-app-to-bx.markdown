title: Port the Chat App to IBM Cloud
---

## Get the code

Clone your chat application repository to your local disk.

## Create a manifest

Create a new deployment `manifest.yml` file in the cloned directory with the content shown below. Be sure to provide a name that is unique within the domain.

<pre>
---
applications:
- name: <span class="app_name">random-app-name</span>
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
</pre>

This is a fairly simple manifest that should work for you as well. If you need want to check for more options please see the  [Cloud Foundry documentation on deployment using manifests](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html).

## Hint: Configure the correct port

IBM Cloud assignes an internal port number to your app automically.

This port number is not visible to the outside world but only used by the routers 
that connect external users to your application.

In your app you can find out correct port at startup like this:

<pre>
let port = process.env.PORT || process.env.VCAP_APP_PORT || 8080;

app.listen(port, () =>  {
  console.log('Server running on port: %d', port);
});
</pre>

## Deploy

Run `cf push` to push this to IBM Cloud. Only proceed to the next step if your app is working correctly.

## Create a CI/CD pipeline

{% include pipeline.markdown %}

  Create a `manifest.yml` with the following content:

  <pre>
      ---
      applications:
      - name: <span class="app_name">whochats</span>
        memory: 128M
        host: <span class="app_name">whochats</span>
  </pre>

    on your local machine. Then manually run `cf push` and verify your app is picking up the right name. _IBM Cloud_ is adding your host to the `eu-de.mybluemix.net` domain  by default so your FQDN is <code><span class="app_name">random-app-name</span>.eu-de.mybluemix.net</code>. Once you can access your hostname, commit and push your changes to git and wait for the pipeline to finish.

## Test

Go to [https://<span class="app_name">random-app-name</span>.eu-de.mybluemix.net](https://<span class="app_name">random-app-name</span>.eu-de.mybluemix.net)
